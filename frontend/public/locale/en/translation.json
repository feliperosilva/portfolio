Armed with two masterâ€™s degrees in classical music and a well-worn metronome, I traded Chopin for Python and stepped into the world of web development â€” where debugging is the new sight-reading.",

While the concert halls have changed, the passion for creativity and problem-solving remains the same â€” just in a slightly more caffeinated setting."
